This is a very simple example of an OSSEC agent for Sguil 0.9.0.  It reads
the OSSEC alert log (/var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log) looking for events
with a priority greater than or equal to 7 (use the -p option to modify this).
When it finds such an alert, it sends it to the Sguil server as a Sguil alert.
You'll be able to tell which events came from OSSEC, because the event
description will start with "[OSSEC]".  

Here's an important note:  Sguil shows SrcIP and DstIP for each alert,
though they are handled a little differently for OSSEC events.  The
agent will set the SrcIP to be the source IP of the OSSEC alert, but
OSSEC doesn't include information about destination IPs.  Therefore,
the agent will fill in the DstIP field with the IP address of the OSSEC
agent that is recording the event (or, if the event came from syslog,
the address of the host that logged the event).  In either case, if 
the agent is unable to resolve the IP addresses, they'll be set to 0.0.0.0.

To use it, set SERVER_HOST, SERVER_PORT and DNS in the ossec_agent.conf
file, then start it up from the command line.  Options are:

Usage: ./ossec_agent.tcl [-D] [-o] [-c <config filename>] [-f <syslog filename>] -i <ipaddr>
  -i <ipaddr>: IP address to associate alert with (required).
  -c <filename>: PATH to config (ossec_agent.conf) file.
  -f <filename>: PATH to OSSEC alert log to monitor.
  -o Enable OpenSSL
  -D Runs ossec_agent in daemon mode.
  -p <int>: Minimum OSSEC event priority on which to alert.

For example, if you want to send Sguil alerts for all OSSEC events of 
priority 5 and above, you could do something like:

  % ossec_agent.tcl -p 5
